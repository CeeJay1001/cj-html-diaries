# 💻 Cece's HTML Diaries: Chapter 1 ✨

Welcome to my first-ever live website hosted with GitHub Pages! This is part of my journey learning HTML and building a space that reflects my personality, interests, and tomboy-coded tech queen energy 😎💅🏽

## 🚀 What’s in this site?

- A personal intro
- Vibes & obsessions (Blackpink supremacy 🖤💖)
- Fun facts and animations
- A glowing interactive button (click it 😏)
- My story: “Echoes of Us”

## 🎨 What I learned:
- Writing clean HTML
- Styling with CSS
- Creating animations (bounce, fade-in, spin, you name it!)
- Hosting on GitHub Pages
